# Week 9 Reflection

## Current Progress 

I have a very basic javascript layout and a text box that you can type in. Basic keyboard shortcuts like ctrl+b and ctrl+c can be used for formatting. Pressing the save button saves the note with formatting to localStorage. The saved note is automatically loaded on refresh. The bold button is not in a state that I'd consider functional.

## Challenges & Lessons

Writing a rich text editor from scratch may not be doable in the timeframe I have; especially since I'm only following the JS documentation rather than any tutorials. 

I have a generalized recursive solution written down for my bold button issues, but haven't had time to implement it. Once I figure out the bold button though, my solution should generalize to applications like font size selection.

I've learned a great deal so far.

I'm making the most of my github repo. I'm actually bothering to create branches which I've never cared to do for small projects before.
